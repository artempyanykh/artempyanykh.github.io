<p class="about-tldr">
  <strong>TL;DR:</strong> I'm a math savvy software engineer passionate about
  productivity and learning. My other interests include skiing, playing the
  ukulele and consuming lots of coffee.

  Hey there! My names is Artem. Formally my <strong>background</strong> is in
  math and computer science, but frankly speaking a consider myself more as a
  mathematician rather than a hardcore CS guy. I specialize on the branch of
  applied math called <em>Operations Research</em>, which mostly deals with
  decision making and multi-criteria optimization.
</p>

<p>
  The topic of my <strong>postgraduate work</strong> is called &ldquo;Repeated
  games with asymmetric information&rdquo;. In short it's about repeated
  interactions between agents and proper handling of <em>&ldquo;he knows that I
  know that he knows&hellip;&rdquo;</em> situations. In essence it's measure
  probability theory and convex optimization mixed into game theoretic
  framework. If you think this sounds pretty fascinating you're definitely
  right.
</p>

<p>
  My other passion is <strong>programming</strong>. A couple years ago I moved
  from Ruby-town to the land of Scala and is happy ever since; perhaps partly
  because Scala allows me to put into work my math oriented brain cells.
</p>

<p>
  And last, but not least, I have to admit that I'm kinda obsessed with
  <strong>productivity</strong>. Usually when people hear
  <em>&ldquo;productivity&rdquo;</em> they think about different techniques
  allowing one to get <em>more</em> stuff done. And, yes, this is usually the
  first step. But I dare to think that I'm currently at step 1.5 which is about
  principles, values and dissecting essential from non-essential.
