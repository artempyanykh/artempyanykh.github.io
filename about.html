    <strong>TL;DR:</strong> I'm a math savvy software engineer passionate about
    productivity and learning. My other interests include skiing, playing the
    ukulele and consuming lots of coffee.

        Hey there! My names is Artem. Formally my <strong>background</strong> is
        in <em>math</em> and <em>computer science</em>, but frankly speaking a
        consider myself more as a mathematician rather than a hardcore CS guy. I
        specialize on the branch of applied math called <em>Operations
        Research</em>, which mostly deals with decision making and
        multi-criteria optimization.
    </p>

    <p>
        The topic of my <strong>postgraduate work</strong> is called
        <em>"Repeated games with asymmetric information"</em>. In short it's
        about repeated interactions between agents and proper handling of
        <em>"he knows that I know that he knows..."</em> situations. In essence
        it's measure probability theory and convex optimization mixed into game
        theoretic framework. If you think this sounds pretty fascinating you're
        definitely right!
    </p>

    <p>
        My other passion is <strong>programming</strong>. A couple years ago I
        moved from hipsterish Ruby-town to the land of Scala and is happy ever
        since; perhaps partly because Scala allows me to put into work my math
        oriented brain cells.

        And last, but not least, I have to admit that I'm kinda obsessed with
        <strong>productivity</strong>. Usually when people hear
        <em>"productivity"</em> they think about different techniques allowing
        one to get <em>more</em> stuff done. And, yes, this is usually the first
        step. But I dare to think that I'm currently at step 1.5 which is about
        principals, values and dissecting essential from non-essential.
