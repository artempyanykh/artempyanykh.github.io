  <strong>TL;DR:</strong> I'm a math savvy software engineer passionate about
  productivity and learning. My other interests include skiing, playing the
  ukulele and coffee.

  Hey there! My names is Artem. My <strong>educational background</strong> is in
  math and computer science, with a specialization on a branch of applied
  mathematics called <em>Operations Research</em>, which is mostly about
  decision making and multi-criteria optimization.
</p>

<p>
  My <strong>postgraduate work</strong> was dedicated to studying
  &ldquo;Repeated Games with Asymmetric Information&rdquo;. In other words, it
  was about repeated interactions between agents, where each agent has certain
  beliefs about what his opponent knows and then does Bayesian inference based
  on opponents's actions. In essence, it's probability theory and convex
  optimization mixed into game theoretic framework.
</p>

<p>
  My other passion is <strong>programming</strong> and, in particular,
  functional programming. Monoids and Groups, Functors and Monads &mdash; I
  enjoy this all. And particularly enjoy building software that is correct by
  construction (at least to some extent). I also don't shy away from low-level
  stuff when need to, especially when it comes to concurrency and performance
  benchmarking.
</p>

<p>
  During my <strong>professional career</strong>, I've been doing Ruby, some
  Java, Scala, some Python, and a bit of Haskell. I've worked on regular
  business software projects, but also did data science and data engineering.
</p>

<p>
  I have experience working as an individual contributor and also as a technical
  leader.
