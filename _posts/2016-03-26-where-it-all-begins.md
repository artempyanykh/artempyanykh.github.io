I like making lists; all sorts of lists. Shopping list, projects list, todo
lists, topic outlines &mdash; you name it. One of these lists is called
_"Long-term goals"_ and item 21 in this list is _"Start a blog"_. Not my top
priority as you can see. However this week I decided to expedite item 21.

Frankly speaking, there's nothing fascinating or original behind this decision,
and it doesn't really deserve a whole blog post. I just felt a strong need to
**structure my thoughts**. For a couple months already I'm writing a journal
where I reflect on the events of past days. The extra clarity I get is
definitely worth 5 minutes in the morning.

Anyway, currently I intend writing about math and programming here; as these are
2 areas I'm mostly interested (and proficient) in. There might also be a post or
two about productivity and GTD. Posts will probably be short enough to fit in a
single screen.

**P.S.** Oh boy! Setting up this blog took me quite a while. I haven't written a
line of `CSS` and `HTML` for several years already. Next thing I plan to do is
to come up with a simple logo and background image to make the page less boring.
Hope there will be a related Adobe Illustrator lesson on YouTube.
